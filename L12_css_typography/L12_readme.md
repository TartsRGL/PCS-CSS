# Lesson 12 -- Advanced Typography

This folder contains the HTML code for **Lesson 12** of the *PCScss* series.

It demonstrates:

* Essential and advanced **CSS typography** properties.
* The use of `text-overflow: ellipsis` for truncated text.
* **Automatic word hyphenation** with `hyphens: auto` and language-aware breaks.
* Applying **custom web fonts** via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
* **Responsive headlines** using `clamp()` for fluid sizing.
* Creating a **multi-column layout** with pure CSS.
* Progressively layered commits—each one adds a new concept.

Each commit adds one conceptual layer step-by-step.
