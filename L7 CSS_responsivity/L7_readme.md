# Lesson 7 – CSS Responsivity (Media Queries)

This folder contains the HTML & CSS code for Lesson 7 of the PCScss series.
It demonstrates:
- Responsive columns with Flexbox
- CSS Variables for spacing, colors and column counts
- Media queries (desktop → tablet → mobile)
- Deterministic widths via .box-3 / .box-4
-Visual breakpoint signals (header color changes)
Each commit adds one layer step-by-step until the final responsive layout.
