# Lesson 9 – Z-index & Stacking Context (Lite)

This folder contains the HTML & CSS code for **Lesson 9** of the *PCScss* series.

It demonstrates:

* The concept of **z-index layering** and how elements visually overlap.
* How **stacking contexts** are created using `transform`, `opacity`, or `isolation`.
* The behavior of local vs. global stacking contexts.
* The role of **fixed positioning** for overlays and modals.

Each commit adds one visual and conceptual layer step-by-step.
