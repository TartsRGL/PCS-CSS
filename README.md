# 🎨 PCS-CSS

Welcome to my CSS dojo.  
This repo continues where [PCS-APP](https://github.com/TartsRGL/PCS-APP) left off – diving deeper into the world of CSS.  
It’s not just about writing styles. It’s about **understanding** them – and breaking them when needed.

## 📚 About the Project

**PCS-CSS** is a structured yet playful journey through the core (and advanced) CSS concepts:

* From selectors to layout systems  
* From variables to visual effects  
* From beginner-friendly basics to professional tricks

Each lesson builds on the last.  
It’s not a textbook – it’s a trajectory.
