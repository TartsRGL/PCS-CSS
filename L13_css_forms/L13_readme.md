# Lesson 13 -- Forms & Accessibility

This folder contains the HTML code for **Lesson 13** of the *PCScss* series.

It demonstrates:

- Semantic and accessible **form structure** (label, input, checkbox)
- Base form layout and spacing
- Focus and focus-visible states for accessibility
- Fully **custom checkbox** using CSS (`:checked`)
- **ARIA attributes** and error messaging
- Progressive enhancement with small JS validation

Each commit adds one conceptual layer step-by-step.
