# Lesson 10 – CSS Transitions & Animations

This folder contains the HTML & CSS code for **Lesson 10** of the *PCScss* series.

It demonstrates:

* The concept of **CSS transitions** (`transition`, `hover` effects).
* The use of **CSS transforms** (`scale`, `rotate`, `translate`).
* The basics of **CSS keyframe animations** (`@keyframes`).
* How animations and transitions can be combined for richer visual effects.

Each commit adds one interactive layer step-by-step.
