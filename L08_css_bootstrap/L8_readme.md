# Lesson 8 – Flex Layout + Bootstrap

This folder contains the HTML & CSS code for Lesson 8 of the **PCScss** series.

It demonstrates:

* Using `display: flex`, `flex-wrap`, `gap`
* Reordering elements with `order` (e.g. `.first`, `.second`)
* Bootstrap navigation bar (via CDN link)
* Practical image gallery layout (Flexbox + Bootstrap)

Each commit adds one feature step-by-step until the final layout.
